echo "# Kidsens Screening App" >> README.md
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Adding got commands"
git push origin main 	

--list the current branches
git branch

--change to the branch name
git branch -M main

git remote add origin https://github.com/Pradep2025/kidsens.git

--to change the link of the remote directory
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Pradep2025/kidsens.git

--list tyhe branches
git remote -v

--if there are any changes in the folder or somebody is already contributing
git pull origin main

--if you get unrelated histories
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

then 
git push origin main


--list the current branches
git branch

--change to the branch name
git branch -M main

If neither "main" nor "master" exist (i.e., if you just initialized a new Git repository), you need to make an initial commit to establish a branch that you can push. Here's how:
echo "# My Project" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main

After these steps, your git push origin main command should work.



#create a new repository on the command line
echo "# to-do" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Pradep2025/to-do.git
git push -u origin main


#push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/Pradep2025/to-do.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
